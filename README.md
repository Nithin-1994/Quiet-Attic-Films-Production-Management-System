In the Quiet Attic Films Production Management System, the platform is structured around
three distinct user roles: Admin, Staff, and Client. Each user role is designed with specific
permissions and responsibilities that align with their function within the film production
process, ensuring that the system operates smoothly and efficiently while maintaining a secure
and organized environment for managing data.

Admin Role
Admins hold the most comprehensive set of permissions within the system, effectively acting
as the overseers and managers of the entire platform. They have the authority to manage every
aspect of the system’s data and operations. This includes the ability to add new records, such
as client information, production details, locations, properties, and staff assignments. Admins
can also update existing information, ensuring that all records are current and accurate. For
example, they can change property details as needed. Nithin Hewavitharana UNIT_04 - Database Design and Development 209
In addition to these capabilities, Admins have the critical power to delete records from the
system. This is a significant responsibility, as it allows them to remove outdated or incorrect
data, ensuring that the database remains clean and relevant. Furthermore, Admins can search
through the database for specific entries, making it easier to locate and manage the vast
amounts of information stored within the system. This search functionality is essential for
quickly finding the necessary data without manually sifting through extensive records. Admins
essentially control the system's overall functionality, ensuring that everything runs smoothly
and that data integrity is maintained across all areas of the platform.

Staff Role
The Staff role is designed to support the production process with a wide range of
functionalities, albeit with some restrictions to maintain data security. Staff members have the
ability to add new data, which includes entering details about ongoing productions, updating
property inventories, and logging client interactions. This capability ensures that all relevant
information is captured and available for future reference.
Staff can also update existing records as necessary. This function allows them to make
changes to the data, such as altering location details. The ability to keep information current is
crucial in a dynamic production environment where details can change rapidly.
However, Staff members are not granted the permission to delete data. This restriction is put
in place to prevent accidental or unauthorized removal of important records, which could lead
to data loss or operational disruptions. By limiting delete permissions, the system ensures that
all critical data remains intact and that only Admins have the authority to remove records. Staff
can also search the database to quickly access the information they need, which is vital for
day-to-day operations.

Client Role
The Client role is tailored to provide users with access to specific information and
functionalities that are relevant to their needs, while limiting their ability to modify or access sensitive data. Clients can view properties and locations that are part of the available property
for productions.
In addition to viewing properties, Clients have the ability to place orders within the system.
By placing orders directly through the system, Clients can streamline the booking process and
ensure that their requests are recorded and managed efficiently.
However, Clients do not have the ability to add, update, or delete any data within the system.
This limitation is intentional, as it prevents unauthorized changes to the system's records and
ensures that only Staff and Admins, who are responsible for maintaining accurate data, can
modify the database. Clients’ access is carefully controlled to allow them to interact with the
system in ways that support their needs while safeguarding the overall integrity of the data.
